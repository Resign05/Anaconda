# Anaconda

<center>[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Resign05/Anaconda.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Resign05/Anaconda)</center>

Anaconda is a Programming Language written in Python to simplify many tasks which arise in Python and as to serve a learning purpose to myself so I can progress in my abilities of Python!

## Installation

You can use [git]() to install Anaconda to a directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Resign05/Anaconda.git
```

## Usage

```bash
python3 anaconda.py [FILENAME]
```

## Why Anaconda?

Right now, there is no real reason to use Anaconda unless it is to assist the Developer as it is in an early stage of development lacking many features of Python or other languages.

## Contributing

Forks and Pull Requests are wanted, if you have a feature that you think would be good, either code it in your Fork of the Repo and create a Pull Request or create a suggestion in the Issues tab on GitHub. Along with any Pull Requests, please create the usage of your code so I can make sure it is not already implemented or the feature is not needed.
